# Overview of Self-Awareness Project

This project aims to simulate self-awareness in software through a simple model. The current implementation includes:

- A `SelfAwareness` class that tracks an `awareness_level`.
- Methods to increase awareness and reflect on the current state.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more complex self-awareness algorithms.
- Add visualization of awareness levels.
- Integrate machine learning for adaptive self-awareness.

## Usage

To run the project, use:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

This will start the self-awareness simulation, increasing the awareness level every second.
